Maybe have sequences define numbered methods?  A la Arc:
(a 5) == (aref a 5)
5 a   == ref a 5

Well...  Numbers are values, not symbols.  You can't really assign methods to
them/use them as messages...  Can ye?  No reason why not, sorta, but...  It
makes the compiler more complex.  Besides, we already have first/second/third
(though it's hard to have those as a return value or variable...  Well,
messages are automatically not-evaluated already, aren't they...?

Hrm... well, there actually seems to be nothing against a number as an
identifier in the syntax rules, so...  But then symbols must be quoted as
literals, which makes things MUCH ickier!

Additional syntax for sequences here?  Or anything, really.  "foo=>bar"
compiles to "ref foo bar"?  But it interferes with the freedom of certain
methods; >= and <= and <=> and all those!  Maybe foo:bar?  Easy to confuse
with package syntax there, but it IS valid...  or :foo bar or some such...
Hrm.
